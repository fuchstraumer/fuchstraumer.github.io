## About Me

I currently work for Tethers Unlimited in Seattle, WA, as our only applications developer in a sea of (thoroughly talented)
embedded systems developers. Currently, I'm supporting efforts to revitalize our tether dynamics and astrodynamics suite
to be cross platform, more performant, more capable, and more adaptive. I've also assisted on NASA SBIR efforts like Refabricator,
CRISSP, CoGZ, and a few others.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries you may have - I'd be glad to respond.
