Personal website for my various articles on graphics programming, music, C++, etc. 

Most of the code is exactly the same as [Massively](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src) - all credit to the original creators. I just chose to rewrote much of it by hand, especially the HTML and some of the sass stuff, in order to get a better handle on this webdev stuff. I've made only a few minor changes, and nearly all of those are visual rather than structural.
