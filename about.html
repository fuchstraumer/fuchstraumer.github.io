                    I currently work for Tethers Unlimited in Seattle, WA, as our only applications developer in a sea of (thoroughly talented)
                    embedded systems developers. Currently, I'm supporting efforts to revitalize our tether dynamics and astrodynamics suite
                    to be cross platform, more performant, more capable, and more adaptive. I've also assisted on NASA SBIR efforts like Refabricator,
                    CRISSP, CoGZ, and a few others.

                    I spend my free time (what little of it I have, anymore) either working on my personal programming projects or, lately, getting back
                    into music production. My personal projects tend to focus on things that interest me the most - that being intricate systems (Vulkan),
                    and fascinating topics like procedural generation of landscapes, worlds, and even solar systems/universes (thus, my interest in procgen
                    and large-scale rendering).

                <p class="author_subtitle">
                    Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to know more about my personal projects or (god forbid) you believe I can help you with your own work.
