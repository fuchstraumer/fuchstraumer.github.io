                    I currently work for a space company somewhere in Washington as our only applications developer in a sea of (thoroughly talented)
                    embedded systems developers. Currently, I'm supporting efforts to revitalize our tether dynamics and astrodynamics suite
                    to be cross platform, more performant, more capable, and more adaptive. I've also assisted on multiple NASA SBIR efforts
                    relating to in-space manufacturing, with the ISM group at NASA MSFC.

                    I spend my free time with friends, and whatever is left over is usually dedicated to personal projects. My personal projects tend to focus on things 
                    that interest me the most - that being intricate systems (Vulkan), and fascinating topics like procedural generation of landscapes, worlds, and even 
                    solar systems/universes (thus, my interest in procgen and large-scale rendering). Maintaining this blog and writing articles is another significant
                    sink of my time, as well.

                    Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to know more about my personal projects or (god forbid) you believe I can help you with your own work.
